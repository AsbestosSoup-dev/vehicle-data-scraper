A Rust-based web scraper designed to collect detailed vehicle data from online listings, such as make, model, year, price, and various performance metrics. The data is stored in a database, allowing for easy analysis of trends and insights in the vehicle market.

Project Goals
-------------
- Gather comprehensive vehicle information, including:
  - Make, model, and year
  - Price
  - Horsepower, torque, weight
  - Fuel type, transmission, body type
  - (Potentially more fields)
- Store data in a database for easy querying and analysis.
- Provide insights and statistics, such as average prices, popular models, and performance trends.

Features
--------
- Web scraping of vehicle listings to gather relevant vehicle specifications.
- Database integration to store and manage vehicle data.
- Basic analysis tools to derive statistics and insights.

Getting Started
---------------

### Prerequisites
- **Rust**: Install Rust from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
- **SQLite**: The initial implementation uses SQLite as the database, so make sure SQLite is installed.
